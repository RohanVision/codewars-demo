// 2725. Interval Cancellation

// Companies
// Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t, return a cancel function cancelFn.

// After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

// setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)
// The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelTimeMs ms.



// Example 1:

// Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35
// Output: 
// [
//    {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
//    {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
//    {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
//    {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
//    {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
//    {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
// ]
// Explanation: 
// const cancelTimeMs = 190;
// const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 2, [4], 35);
// setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

// Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
// 1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
// 2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
// 3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
// 4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
// 5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
// 6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
// Cancelled at 190ms
// Example 2:

// Input: fn = (x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), args = [2, 5], t = 30
// Output: 
// [
//    {"time": 0, "returned": 10},
//    {"time": 30, "returned": 10},
//    {"time": 60, "returned": 10},
//    {"time": 90, "returned": 10},
//    {"time": 120, "returned": 10},
//    {"time": 150, "returned": 10}
// ]
// Explanation: 
// const cancelTimeMs = 165; 
// const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), [2, 5], 30) 
// setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

// Every 30ms, fn(2, 5) is called. Until t=165ms, then it is cancelled.
// 1st fn call is at 0ms 
// 2nd fn call is at 30ms 
// 3rd fn call is at 60ms 
// 4th fn call is at 90ms 
// 5th fn call is at 120ms 
// 6th fn call is at 150ms
// Cancelled at 165ms
// Example 3:

// Input: fn = (x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), args = [5, 1, 3], t = 50
// Output: 
// [
//    {"time": 0, "returned": 9},
//    {"time": 50, "returned": 9},
//    {"time": 100, "returned": 9},
//    {"time": 150, "returned": 9}
// ]
// Explanation: 
// const cancelTimeMs = 180;
// const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), [5, 1, 3], 50)
// setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

// Every 50ms, fn(5, 1, 3) is called. Until t=180ms, then it is cancelled. 
// 1st fn call is at 0ms
// 2nd fn call is at 50ms
// 3rd fn call is at 100ms
// 4th fn call is at 150ms
// Cancelled at 180ms


// Constraints:

// fn is a function
// args is a valid JSON array
// 1 <= args.length <= 10
// 30 <= t <= 100
// 10 <= cancelTimeMs <= 500


// Explanation Approach
// 1. Call fn(...args).
// 2. Set an interval timer.The setInterval function in the code below will call() => fn(...args) every t milliseconds.Note, setInterval does not initially call the function before t milliseconds, which is why we call fn(...args) once before setting the interval.
// 3. Now, we define a cancelFn function, which clears the interval when called.Return cancelFn.
//     i.The function cancelFn is not called when our cancellable function is first defined.However, whenever someone calls cancellable, the line return cancelFn, in order to return, will call and execute cancelFn, thereby cancelling the interval.
//         ii.For example, if we define var myFunc = cancellable((num) => 1 + num, 13, 100), the interval will repeatedly call (num) => 1 + num until myFunc() is called.When myFunc() is called, the return line in myFunc is read, which will consequentially make cancelFn execute and return, thereby clearing the interval.
